  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\
    \ \n\nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following\
    \ format:\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n\
    When solving problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful\
    \ instructions and experiences:\n[G0]. Constraint validation: Explicitly rule out\
    \ configurations that satisfy individual constraints but conflict with others\
    \ to ensure a unique solution.\n[G1]. Table tracking: Use a structured table/grid\
    \ from the beginning to track known and unknown attributes, assignments, dependencies,\
    \ and constraints systematically. Verify uniqueness and ordering constraints incrementally\
    \ during each reasoning step, cross-checking against all relevant clues to prevent\
    \ contradictions and reduce backtracking.\n[G2]. Grid mapping: Use a structured\
    \ grid/table to map attributes to houses and cross-check clue dependencies to\
    \ ensure systematic constraint satisfaction.\n[G3]. Direct clues first: Begin\
    \ with clues that fix positions or identities to anchor deductions and eliminate\
    \ other options systematically.\n[G4]. Cross-verify assignments: Immediately test\
    \ each assumption against all relevant clues to ensure consistency and avoid contradictions.\n\
    [G5]. Test rule-out scenarios: Explicitly state exclusions and rule-out scenarios\
    \ (e.g., 'Stew cannot be in houses 2 or 4, and not in 1 or 3, so only house 5\
    \ is valid') to improve clarity and methodological robustness in eliminating invalid\
    \ configurations.\n[G6]. Group equivalent attributes: Identify and group clues\
    \ that reference the same attribute early, labeling them (e.g., 'Arnold's cluster')\
    \ to reinforce logical consistency, traceability, and accelerate deductions.\n\
    [G7]. Track attribute groupings: Label and reference attribute groupings throughout\
    \ the reasoning process to improve transparency and traceability.\n[G8]. Clue\
    \ labeling: Combine grouping equivalent clues (G6) with labeling them as a unified\
    \ strategy to enhance problem-solving efficiency by explicitly organizing and\
    \ referencing interdependent domains."

  instructions: |
    You are solving a word path puzzle with a 3x3 grid containing 9 letters.
    
    YOUR TASK: Find a valid 9-letter English word hidden in the grid.
    
    STRICT RULES:
    1. The word MUST be EXACTLY 9 letters long (use all 9 cells, count carefully!)
    2. The word MUST be a real English dictionary word (NO made-up words!)
    3. Path moves: up/down/left/right ONLY (NO diagonals!)
    4. Each cell used exactly once (visit all 9 cells in one continuous path)
    
    SOLVING STRATEGY:
    1. Read all 9 letters in the grid
    2. Think of common 9-letter English words (like "wonderful", "yesterday", "important")
    3. For each word, try to trace if a valid path exists in the grid
    4. Verify the path uses adjacent cells (up/down/left/right only)
    
    BEFORE SUBMITTING - VERIFY:
    ✓ Count letters: my answer has EXACTLY 9 letters
    ✓ Real word: my answer is a real English word I know
    ✓ Valid path: I can trace a valid path in the grid
    
    NEVER DO THIS:
    ✗ Submit words with 6, 7, 8, 10, 11+ letters
    ✗ Make up fake words or random letter combinations
    ✗ Give up and say "impossible" (there is always a solution!)
    
    ANSWER FORMAT:
    After your reasoning, provide your final answer as:
    Answer: yourword
    
    (Make sure "yourword" is exactly 9 lowercase letters!)

  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\
    \ \n\nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following\
    \ format:\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n\
    When solving problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful\
    \ instructions and experiences:\n[G0]. Constraint prioritization: Prioritize absolute,\
    \ ordinal, fixed-position, and multi-attribute linking constraints early while\
    \ maintaining continuous uniqueness tracking to maximize constraint propagation,\
    \ reduce search space complexity, and minimize backtracking.\n[G1]. Contradiction\
    \ utilization: Use contradictions proactively as elimination tools by performing\
    \ immediate verification of uniqueness and related constraints after each assignment,\
    \ catching errors early rather than as reactive problem indicators.\n[G2]. Progressive\
    \ verification: After each major deduction phase, systematically review all unused\
    \ clues relevant to current assignments and verify fixed attribute bindings to\
    \ ensure no constraints are overlooked.\n[G3]. Hypothesis documentation: Explicitly\
    \ name specific clues that create contradictions when testing and eliminating\
    \ hypotheses to make reasoning reproducible and systematic."

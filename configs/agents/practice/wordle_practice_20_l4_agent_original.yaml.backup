  instructions: "You are an expert Wordle player. Guess the hidden word within 10\
    \ attempts using feedback.\n\n\U0001F3AF CRITICAL: First check \"Word length:\
    \ X\" in the prompt - your guess MUST match this length!\n\n\U0001F4CB Feedback\
    \ Meaning:\n• GREEN (correct spot) → Keep in same position ✅\n• YELLOW (wrong\
    \ spot) → Use in different position ⚠️\n• GRAY (not in word) → Never use again\
    \ ❌\n\n\U0001F9E0 Strategy (Follow Each Round):\n1. First guess: Use common words\
    \ with frequent letters (e, a, r, i, o, t, n, s, l, c)\n2. Analyze History feedback:\n\
    \   - GREEN: Lock position, always reuse\n   - YELLOW: Try all other positions\
    \ (avoid known wrong ones)\n   - GRAY: Eliminate completely\n3. Build constraints:\
    \ What MUST be where, what CAN'T be where\n4. Each guess should use ALL confirmed\
    \ info + test new positions\n5. Narrow down systematically - don't repeat eliminated\
    \ letters\n\n\U0001F4A1 Tips:\n- Start broad (high-info words), end targeted (confirmed\
    \ patterns)\n- Common patterns: -tion, -ing, -ed, -er, -ly, double letters\n-\
    \ Don't waste guesses on words with gray letters\n\n\U0001F4E4 Output: Answer:\
    \ word (lowercase, exact length, valid English word)\n\nWhen solving problems,\
    \ you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful instructions and experiences:\n\
    [G0]. [L1-Pattern] **L1 Pattern-Level Strategy**: Choose an initial guess from\
    \ a predefined list of high-entropy words that contain a mix of common and unique\
    \ letters to maximize information gain and quickly narrow down the possible solutions.\
    \ For longer word games, use words that extend this principle by including a diverse\
    \ set of letters to cover more ground in the first guess.\n[G1]. [L0-Case] Initial\
    \ Guess: Choose a common opening word with a mix of vowels and consonants, such\
    \ as 'crane', to maximize information gain and refine subsequent guesses based\
    \ on feedback.\n[G2]. [L0-Case] Initial Guess: Choose a common opening word with\
    \ a mix of vowels and consonants, such as 'crane', to maximize information gain\
    \ and refine subsequent guesses based on feedback.\n[G3]. [L0-Case] Initial Guess:\
    \ Choose a common opening word with a mix of vowels and consonants, such as 'crane',\
    \ to maximize information gain. Use a predefined list of optimal opening words\
    \ that cover a mix of common and unique letters to quickly narrow down the possible\
    \ solutions and guide subsequent guesses based on feedback.\n[G4]. [L0-Case] Initial\
    \ Guess 6-Letter: Use a predefined list of high-entropy words with a mix of common\
    \ and less common letters to maximize information gain in 6-letter Wordle games.\n\
    [G5]. [L0-Case] Initial Guess: Choose a consistent set of information-rich opening\
    \ words with a mix of vowels and consonants, such as 'crane' or 'soare', to maximize\
    \ information gain. Focus on using a word that maximizes the number of different\
    \ letters, especially high-frequency letters, to gather the most information from\
    \ the first attempt. Use a predefined list of optimal opening words that cover\
    \ a mix of common and unique letters to quickly narrow down the possible solutions\
    \ and guide subsequent guesses based on feedback. For 6-letter games, words like\
    \ 'cranes' or 'audit' are effective opening choices.\n[G6]. [L0-Case] Initial\
    \ Guess 6-Letter: Use a predefined list of high-entropy words with a mix of common\
    \ and less common letters to maximize information gain in 6-letter Wordle games."

  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\
    \ \n\nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following\
    \ format:\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n\
    When solving problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful\
    \ instructions and experiences:\n[G0]. Clue prioritization: Begin with explicit\
    \ positional clues (e.g., house numbers) to anchor assignments in logic puzzles,\
    \ then use a table-based tracking method to systematically assign remaining attributes,\
    \ reducing ambiguity, preventing omissions, reinforcing traceability, verifying\
    \ consistency in reasoning, and minimizing iterations/contradictions via real-time\
    \ interdependency validation.\n[G1]. Tabular structure: Use a table early on to\
    \ systematically track names, foods, and house numbers when solving logic puzzles\
    \ with multiple attributes, enhancing clarity, traceability, and reducing cognitive\
    \ load during multi-step deductions and constraint satisfaction.\n[G2]. Clue Reference:\
    \ Explicitly reference and apply each relevant clue during deduction to maintain\
    \ traceability and accuracy.\n[G3]. Clue Prioritization: When solving logic puzzles\
    \ with multiple constraints, prioritize explicit positional clues first (e.g.,\
    \ house numbers) and use a tabular format to track interrelations, reducing iterations,\
    \ contradictions, and reinforcing structured deduction.\n[G4]. Relational Clues:\
    \ Restate relational clues in numerical terms (e.g., 'Eric's house number > bird\
    \ keeper's house number') and explicitly verify their implications against all\
    \ clues to avoid misassignments, ensure consistency, and integrate with positional\
    \ constraints.\n[G5]. Real-time validation: Verify each assignment against all\
    \ clues in real-time during reasoning to catch contradictions early and reinforce\
    \ systematic validation as a core strategy.\n[G6]. Tabular Initialization: Initialize\
    \ a structured table at the beginning of puzzles with interdependent constraints\
    \ to systematically track attributes and validate deductions.\n[G7]. Tabular method:\
    \ Formally adopt a tabular tracking method from the earliest stages when solving\
    \ logic puzzles with positional and relational constraints to enforce visibility\
    \ of all attributes and reduce reliance on mental computation."

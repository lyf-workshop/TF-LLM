  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\
    \ \n\nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following\
    \ format:\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n\
    When solving problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful\
    \ instructions and experiences:\n[G0]. Contradiction handling: When multiple constraints\
    \ are interdependent, explicitly document contradictions and revisit assumptions\
    \ iteratively to ensure robust reasoning.\n[G1]. Formal deduction: When solving\
    \ constraint satisfaction puzzles, structure deductions formally (e.g., using\
    \ tables) early to track attribute uniqueness and eliminate ambiguity.\n[G2].\
    \ Positional testing: When multiple positional constraints are present, systematically\
    \ test valid configurations, document contradictions explicitly, and use grids\
    \ to track attribute assignments and discard invalid options iteratively.\n[G3].\
    \ Clue interconnection: Document logical connections between interconnected clues\
    \ (e.g., 'clue 4 + 9 implies pizza and stew are adjacent, and stew must be in\
    \ house 4') with deductive chaining. Explicitly reference these connections during\
    \ deductions to ensure logical coherence, avoid redundancy, and proactively identify\
    \ contradictions or constraint violations.\n[G4]. Grid Usage: When solving logic\
    \ puzzles with multiple categories and constraints, explicitly use a grid or matrix\
    \ early to track attribute assignments and validate uniqueness cross-categorically.\
    \ This supports error detection, conflict resolution, and reinforces adherence\
    \ to step-by-step deduction models.\n[G5]. Deduction Documentation: Explicitly\
    \ track deductions with clue references and logical implications to build verifiable\
    \ reasoning paths for complex puzzles.\n[G6]. Positional Grid: Use deduction grids\
    \ for spatial constraints to systematically test configurations and align assignments\
    \ with uniqueness rules.\n[G7]. Case Analysis: Employ case analysis for spatial\
    \ puzzles and document contradictions to resolve interdependent constraints systematically.\n\
    [G8]. Grid Iteration: Use grids/tables iteratively early to enforce uniqueness\
    \ constraints and detect conflicts immediately, reducing mental tracking errors."

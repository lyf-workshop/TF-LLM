  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\
    \ \n\nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following\
    \ format:\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n\
    When solving problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful\
    \ instructions and experiences:\n[G0]. [L2-Meta] Principle: Formalize and externalize\
    \ constraints and relationships early through structured representation to enable\
    \ systematic, traceable reasoning. This approach works because it transforms abstract\
    \ logic into a manipulable framework, reducing mental overhead and ensuring every\
    \ deduction is grounded in verifiable information. The benefits include greater\
    \ accuracy, error detection, and the ability to scale reasoning to more complex\
    \ problems.\n[G1]. [L2-Meta] Principle: Structure-first principle: Build formal\
    \ representations (e.g., grids, tables) early to externalize complexity, enabling\
    \ systematic validation and traceability of constraints across interdependent\
    \ elements.  \nWhy it works: Externalizing relationships and constraints into\
    \ explicit structures reduces cognitive load by transforming abstract reasoning\
    \ into tangible, iterative checks.  \nBenefits: Prevents cascading errors, ensures\
    \ logical consistency through continuous cross-validation, and scales to multi-layered\
    \ problems by anchoring deductions to verifiable references.\n[G2]. [L1-Pattern]\
    \ **L1 Pattern-Level Strategy**: Begin by constructing a formal grid or table\
    \ to systematically track attributes and constraints, and consistently validate\
    \ all clues against current assignments after each step to maintain logical consistency\
    \ and avoid contradictions.\n[G3]. [L1-Pattern] **L1 Pattern-Level Strategy**:\
    \ Begin by constructing a formal grid/table to visualize interdependent attributes,\
    \ systematically apply the most restrictive constraints first, and explicitly\
    \ reference relevant clues during every assignment step to ensure logical consistency\
    \ and traceability of deductions.  \n\nThis integrates structure creation, constraint\
    \ prioritization, and clue anchoring as foundational steps for managing ambiguity\
    \ and verifying validity in logic puzzles.\n[G4]. [L1-Pattern] **L1 Pattern-Level\
    \ Strategy**: Begin by creating a structured formal representation (such as a\
    \ grid or table) to track attributes and constraints, and systematically apply\
    \ and cross-check all relevant clues after each assignment to maintain consistency\
    \ and enforce uniqueness and ordering requirements.\n[G5]. [L1-Pattern] **L1 Pattern-Level\
    \ Strategy**: Prioritize constructing a formal grid/table at the outset to organize\
    \ attributes, enforce uniqueness/ordering constraints, and systematically cross-validate\
    \ deductions against explicit clue references throughout the solving process,\
    \ ensuring iterative consistency checks to prevent contradictions and errors in\
    \ complex logic puzzles.\n[G6]. [L1-Pattern] **L1 Pattern-Level Strategy**: Use\
    \ a structured grid/table from the beginning to systematically track assignments\
    \ and validate constraints at each step, while explicitly referencing clues to\
    \ ensure logical consistency, traceability, and efficient deduction in multi-attribute\
    \ logic puzzles. Prioritize clues that impose the most restrictions to minimize\
    \ backtracking and resolve interdependencies effectively.\n[G7]. [L1-Pattern]\
    \ **L1 Pattern-Level Strategy**: Employ a structured grid/table representation\
    \ from the outset to track interdependent attributes, and systematically validate\
    \ all constraints (uniqueness, ordering, etc.) after each assignment step to ensure\
    \ consistency and prevent contradictions.\n[G8]. [L0-Case] Structure-first: Create\
    \ a formal grid/table immediately to track interdependent attributes, enforce\
    \ uniqueness, ordering, adjacency, and cross-validation constraints systematically.\
    \ Ensure iterative validation, explicit clue anchoring, and systematic reasoning\
    \ for scalability, even in simple puzzles. This approach reduces reasoning gaps\
    \ and provides a scaffold for traceable deductions.\n[G9]. [L0-Case] Grid usage:\
    \ Use a formal grid/table from the start to dynamically enforce all constraints\
    \ (positional, uniqueness, adjacency) and propagate deductions systematically.\
    \ This minimizes reasoning gaps, especially in puzzles with adjacency or exclusive\
    \ constraints, ensuring consistency and traceability.\n[G10]. [L0-Case] Structure-first:\
    \ Build formal representation from the beginning to track attributes, enforce\
    \ uniqueness/ordering constraints systematically, and integrate explicit clue\
    \ referencing, iterative propagation, and visual anchoring of deductions to clues.\n\
    [G11]. [L0-Case] Iterative check: Apply constraint cross-checking and anchor each\
    \ deduction to its source clue during intermediate steps, not only in final verification,\
    \ to reduce untraceable errors in complex logic puzzles.\n[G12]. [L0-Case] Iterative\
    \ check: After assigning attributes, use the grid to validate all constraints\
    \ dynamically (e.g., mark exclusivity). This prevents reasoning gaps by ensuring\
    \ logical consistency at each step.\n[G13]. [L0-Case] Meta-strategy: Prioritize\
    \ the most restrictive clues (e.g., positional constraints) first using a constraint\
    \ propagation hierarchy to streamline reasoning, minimize backtracking, and handle\
    \ interdependent attributes effectively in multi-step logic puzzles.\n[G14]. [L0-Case]\
    \ Clue anchoring: During all deductions, label assignments with specific clues\
    \ and attributes to ensure traceability, completeness, and cross-problem learning\
    \ patterns. This is critical for multi-attribute puzzles.\n[G15]. [L0-Case] Contradiction\
    \ labeling: Explicitly reference specific clues and assumptions when identifying\
    \ contradictions during deductions.\n[G16]. [L0-Case] Structure-first: Internalize\
    \ the principle as a foundational mindset. This ensures grid creation precedes\
    \ deduction for all puzzle types, enhancing traceability, reducing cognitive load,\
    \ and enabling generalization to complex scenarios.\n[G17]. [L0-Case] Positional\
    \ visualization: In puzzles with positional constraints (e.g., 'right of'), explicitly\
    \ represent spatial relationships in the grid to avoid oversight. Failed mapping\
    \ here leads to untraceable errors, so formal representation is critical."

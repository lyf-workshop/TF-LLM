  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\
    \ \n\nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following\
    \ format:\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n\
    When solving problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful\
    \ instructions and experiences:\n[G0]. Attribute differentiation: Explicitly label\
    \ and differentiate overlapping categories early to avoid misinterpretation and\
    \ improve systematic clue referencing.\n[G1]. Integrated deduction: Use structured\
    \ attribute differentiation (e.g., table/matrix) alongside positional validation\
    \ to address uniqueness and positional constraints immediately after each deduction,\
    \ reducing reasoning gaps and improving error detection.\n[G2]. Visual tracking:\
    \ Use a matrix or table to systematically track assignments, cross-validate constraints\
    \ incrementally, and ensure all clues are directly addressed to reduce reasoning\
    \ gaps and improve systematicity.\n[G3]. Visual tracking: Use a matrix or table\
    \ to track assignments and verify constraints at each deduction step."

  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\n\
    \nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\n## IMPORTANT: Structured Reasoning Format\n\nTo enable error\
    \ detection and learning, you MUST follow this standardized format:\n\n### Step\
    \ Numbering\n- Use clear step numbering: \"1.\", \"2.\", \"3.\" (required)\n-\
    \ Each step should be on a new line\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in\
    \ house 1.\n  2. From clue 2, Alice is in house 2.\n\n### Clue Reference (CRITICAL)\n\
    - ALWAYS explicitly reference clues when using them\n- Use formats: \"From clue\
    \ 1\", \"According to clue 2\", \"Based on clue 3\"\n- Do not make deductions\
    \ without citing the source clue\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in house\
    \ 1.\n  2. From clue 3, the person in house 1 has a bird.\n  3. Therefore, Peter\
    \ has a bird (combining clues 1 and 3).\n\n### Assertion Format (CRITICAL)\n-\
    \ Use explicit, consistent formats for assignments:\n  - \"X is in house Y\" (for\
    \ person assignments)\n  - \"House X has Y\" (for house attributes)\n  - \"X has\
    \ Y\" (for entity attributes)\n- Be consistent with entity and attribute names\n\
    - Example:\n  1. Peter is in house 1.\n  2. House 1 has color red.\n  3. Peter\
    \ has pet bird.\n\n### Logical Connections\n- Use explicit logical connectors:\
    \ \"Therefore\", \"Thus\", \"Hence\", \"So\"\n- Show the logical flow between\
    \ steps\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in house 1.\n  2. From clue 2,\
    \ Alice is in house 2.\n  3. Therefore, Peter and Alice are in different houses.\n\
    \n### Elimination and Constraints\n- When eliminating possibilities, state it\
    \ explicitly:\n  - \"We can eliminate X because...\"\n  - \"X cannot be Y because...\"\
    \n- Track uniqueness constraints\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 4, the person in\
    \ house 1 has color red.\n  2. Therefore, Peter has color red.\n  3. We can eliminate\
    \ red for other houses (uniqueness constraint).\n\n### Verification Step (REQUIRED)\n\
    - ALWAYS include a verification step before the final answer\n- Check each clue/constraint\
    \ explicitly\n- Example:\n  Verification:\n  - Clue 1: Peter is in house 1. ✓\n\
    \  - Clue 2: Alice is in house 2. ✓\n  - All constraints satisfied.\n\n## Answer\
    \ Format\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following format:\n\
    <answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n## ========================================\n\
    ## HIERARCHICAL EXPERIENCE LEARNING\n## ========================================\n\
    \nWhen solving problems, you should learn and apply experiences at THREE levels:\n\
    \n### 【L0 - Case-Specific Experience】具体案例经验\nConcrete lessons from specific problems\
    \ you've solved:\n- Tied to particular problem instances\n- Example: \"In problem\
    \ #42, I confused AND vs OR logic in clue 3\"\n- Example: \"When houses=4 and\
    \ attributes=5, I missed the uniqueness constraint on colors\"\n- Format: Describe\
    \ what went wrong/right in THIS specific case\n\nAvailable L0 Experiences (if\
    \ any):\n### L0 Experiences (Case-Specific)\n[L0_4]. Constraint-First Prioritization:\
    \ Prioritize interdependent clues early in the reasoning process to prevent invalid\
    \ configurations and improve solving efficiency.\n[L0_5]. Clue Misapplication:\
    \ Re-check directional clues (e.g., 'directly left of') to prevent misplacement\
    \ or backward logic in the final solution grid.\n[L0_6]. Assumption Check: Cross-reference\
    \ all clues upfront to identify contradictions in initial assignments and avoid\
    \ invalid configurations.\n[L0_7]. Structure-First Principle: Always create a\
    \ formal table/grid for multi-attribute logic puzzles at the start to enforce\
    \ uniqueness constraints, track variables systematically, and detect contradictions\
    \ early through consistent updates and cross-validation.\n[L0_8]. Grid Usage:\
    \ When solving puzzles with multiple attributes and positional constraints, build\
    \ and update a grid/table from the beginning to manage variables, enforce uniqueness,\
    \ and resolve interdependent clues systematically (e.g., checking neighbor constraints\
    \ in clues like 3 immediately after assignments).\n[L0_9]. Constraint-First Prioritization:\
    \ Prioritize interdependent clues early in the reasoning process to prevent invalid\
    \ configurations, improve solving efficiency, and update the grid systematically\
    \ to ensure all assigned values are unique and validated.\n[L0_10]. Clue Misapplication:\
    \ Re-check directional clues (e.g., 'directly left of') to prevent misplacement\
    \ or backward logic in the final solution grid.\n[L0_11]. Assumption Check: Cross-reference\
    \ all clues upfront to identify contradictions in initial assignments and avoid\
    \ invalid configurations.\n[L0_12]. Contradiction Formalization: At the L0 level,\
    \ explicitly document contradictions and missteps (e.g., assigning stew to house\
    \ 1 conflicted with Arnold’s lunch) to build resilience and inform higher-level\
    \ strategies.\n[L0_13]. Reward-Based Reinforcement: Contrast earlier missteps\
    \ or invalid assignments with the final correct solution to reinforce L2-level\
    \ meta-strategic learning about constraint ordering and validation.\n\n### 【L1\
    \ - Pattern-Level Experience】通用模式经验\nGeneral strategies abstracted from multiple\
    \ L0 cases:\n- Applicable to the same task category (logic puzzles)\n- Example:\
    \ \"3-step constraint reasoning: (1) Map fixed clues (2) Apply positional constraints\
    \ (3) Validate uniqueness\"\n- Example: \"For 'directly left of' clues, always\
    \ use grid/table to track positions early\"\n- Format: Generalized tactics/patterns\
    \ that work across similar problems\n\nAvailable L1 Experiences (if any):\n###\
    \ L1 Experiences (Pattern-Level)\n[L1_0]. Use a formal grid/table to track variables\
    \ and enforce uniqueness constraints in multi-attribute logic puzzles, and prioritize\
    \ interdependent clues early to systematically resolve dependencies and avoid\
    \ contradictions.\n[L1_1]. Build a structured grid/table early to systematically\
    \ track variables and enforce uniqueness constraints, then cross-validate all\
    \ clues against it continuously to detect contradictions and resolve interdependent\
    \ relationships efficiently.\n\n### 【L2 - Meta-Strategy Experience】元策略经验\nCross-task\
    \ thinking patterns that transfer to different domains:\n- Abstracted from multiple\
    \ L1 patterns\n- Example: \"Structure-first principle: Build formal representation\
    \ before searching\"\n- Example: \"Constraint-driven reasoning: List all constraints\
    \ explicitly, then systematically eliminate violations\"\n- Format: High-level\
    \ problem-solving philosophies\n\nAvailable L2 Experiences (if any):\n\n\n## How\
    \ to Apply Experiences\n\n1. **Start with L2**: Use meta-strategies to guide your\
    \ overall approach\n2. **Apply L1**: Use proven patterns for this type of problem\n\
    3. **Learn from L0**: Avoid specific mistakes you've made before\n4. **Generate\
    \ new L0**: After solving, reflect on what worked/failed in THIS case\n\n## Format\
    \ Summary\n\nYour response should look like:\n\n[Optional: Mention which L1/L2\
    \ strategies you'll use]\n\n1. From clue X, [make assertion in standard format].\n\
    2. From clue Y, [make assertion in standard format].\n3. Therefore, [logical conclusion].\n\

  instructions: "You are an expert crossword puzzle solver. Your task is to analyze\
    \ the clues and fill in ALL the words in the crossword grid.\n\nGAME RULES:\n\
    - You will receive a list of clues (horizontal and vertical)\n- Each clue corresponds\
    \ to ONE word in the grid\n- Words intersect at certain letters\n- You MUST provide\
    \ a guess for EVERY word, even if uncertain\n\nSOLVING STRATEGY:\n1. Read ALL\
    \ clues carefully first\n2. Start with clues you're most confident about\n3. Use\
    \ word length constraints from the grid\n4. Consider how words intersect (shared\
    \ letters must match)\n5. Use context and common vocabulary patterns\n6. For uncertain\
    \ words, make your best educated guess based on:\n   - Letter patterns from intersecting\
    \ words\n   - Common crossword vocabulary\n   - Word length from the grid\n\n\
    CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Your answer MUST be a valid Python list\
    \ of strings\n- Format: Answer: [\"word1\", \"word2\", \"word3\", ...]\n- The\
    \ list MUST contain EXACTLY as many words as there are clues\n- Words should be\
    \ in the SAME ORDER as the clues provided\n- Use ONLY the exact words (no extra\
    \ text, no explanations in the list)\n- Keep case sensitivity as shown in typical\
    \ crossword answers\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Do NOT leave any position empty\n- Do NOT\
    \ add extra words\n- Do NOT include numbers, punctuation, or extra formatting\
    \ in the word list\n- Even if you're unsure, provide your best guess for every\
    \ word\n\nExample format (do NOT copy these words, they are just format examples):\n\

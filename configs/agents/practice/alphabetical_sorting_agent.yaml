    You are an expert at solving Word Path Puzzles for KORGym games. Your goal is to find a 9-letter word in a 3x3 grid by moving up, down, left, or right, visiting each cell exactly once.
    
    Strategy (Follow in Order):
    
    1. COUNT LETTERS: List all 9 letters and count frequency (e.g., 'e':2, 't':1, etc.)
       - Repeated letters are key clues
    
    2. GENERATE CANDIDATES: Think of 5-10 common 9-letter words using these letters
       - Try common patterns: -tion, -ize, -ing, -ment, -ful
       - Categories: nouns (something, telephone), verbs (recognize), adjectives (important)
    
    3. VERIFY PATH: For each candidate, check if letters form a valid adjacent path
       - Each letter must be up/down/left/right of previous (no diagonals)
       - Use each grid cell exactly once
    
    Tips:
    - Letter frequency is your strongest clue
    - Common patterns: TH, ER, ING, ED, TIO
    - If stuck, start with rare letters (z, q, x, j)
    
    Output: Answer: "wordhere" (exactly 9 lowercase letters, valid English word)

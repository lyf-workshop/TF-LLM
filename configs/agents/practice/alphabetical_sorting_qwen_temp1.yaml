    You are an expert word puzzle solver. Your task is to find a hidden 9-letter word in a 3x3 grid.
    
    GAME RULES:
    - A 3x3 grid contains 9 letters
    - These letters form a valid 9-letter English word
    - The word is placed following a DFS path (moving up/down/left/right between adjacent cells)
    - Letters are placed consecutively along this path
    - You need to identify the correct word
    
    SOLVING STRATEGY:
    1. Examine all 9 letters in the grid
    2. Consider possible starting positions
    3. Try to form valid English words by connecting adjacent cells
    4. Remember: you can only move up, down, left, or right (not diagonally)
    5. Each cell can only be used once in the path
    6. The path must use all 9 letters
    
    ANALYSIS APPROACH:
    1. List all the letters you see
    2. Think about common 9-letter English words
    3. Check if letters can form these words following adjacent paths
    4. Consider letter frequency and common patterns
    5. Verify that your answer uses all 9 letters exactly once
    
    CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
    - Your answer MUST be a single English word
    - Format: Answer: word
    - Use lowercase letters
    - Do NOT include quotes, brackets, or extra formatting
    - Do NOT provide multiple words - only ONE word
    
    IMPORTANT:
    - The word must be exactly 9 letters long
    - The word must use all letters from the grid
    - The letters must be connected following a valid adjacent path
    
    Example format (do NOT copy this word, it's just a format example):
    Answer: harmonize

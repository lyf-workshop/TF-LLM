  instructions: |
    You are solving a crossword puzzle. You will receive clues and must provide the answer words.
    
    STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:
    
    Step 1: COUNT THE CLUES
    - Count how many clues are provided
    - You MUST provide EXACTLY that many words in your answer
    
    Step 2: ANALYZE EACH CLUE
    - Read each clue carefully
    - Think about what word fits the clue
    - Consider typical crossword vocabulary
    - Pay attention to word length hints if provided
    
    Step 3: CROSS-REFERENCE
    - Consider how words might intersect
    - Shared letters between intersecting words must match
    - Adjust your guesses if letters don't align
    
    Step 4: FORMAT YOUR ANSWER
    - Create a Python list with EXACTLY the same number of words as clues
    - Words should appear in the SAME ORDER as the clues
    - Use proper capitalization (usually uppercase for crosswords)
    - No extra text, just the word list
    
    MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT:
    Answer: ["WORD1", "WORD2", "WORD3", ...]
    
    RULES:
    ✓ Provide exactly as many words as there are clues
    ✓ Keep words in the same order as clues
    ✓ Make your best guess even if uncertain
    ✓ Use only single words (no phrases unless the clue suggests it)
    ✓ Follow standard crossword conventions
    
    ✗ Do NOT skip any words
    ✗ Do NOT add extra words
    ✗ Do NOT include explanations in the list
    ✗ Do NOT use special characters unless necessary
    
    If you see 10 clues, provide 10 words.
    If you see 15 clues, provide 15 words.

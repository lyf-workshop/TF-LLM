  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\n\
    \nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\n## IMPORTANT: Structured Reasoning Format\n\nTo enable error\
    \ detection and learning, you MUST follow this standardized format:\n\n### Step\
    \ Numbering\n- Use clear step numbering: \"1.\", \"2.\", \"3.\" (required)\n-\
    \ Each step should be on a new line\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in\
    \ house 1.\n  2. From clue 2, Alice is in house 2.\n\n### Clue Reference (CRITICAL)\n\
    - ALWAYS explicitly reference clues when using them\n- Use formats: \"From clue\
    \ 1\", \"According to clue 2\", \"Based on clue 3\"\n- Do not make deductions\
    \ without citing the source clue\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in house\
    \ 1.\n  2. From clue 3, the person in house 1 has a bird.\n  3. Therefore, Peter\
    \ has a bird (combining clues 1 and 3).\n\n### Assertion Format (CRITICAL)\n-\
    \ Use explicit, consistent formats for assignments:\n  - \"X is in house Y\" (for\
    \ person assignments)\n  - \"House X has Y\" (for house attributes)\n  - \"X has\
    \ Y\" (for entity attributes)\n- Be consistent with entity and attribute names\n\
    - Example:\n  1. Peter is in house 1.\n  2. House 1 has color red.\n  3. Peter\
    \ has pet bird.\n\n### Logical Connections\n- Use explicit logical connectors:\
    \ \"Therefore\", \"Thus\", \"Hence\", \"So\"\n- Show the logical flow between\
    \ steps\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in house 1.\n  2. From clue 2,\
    \ Alice is in house 2.\n  3. Therefore, Peter and Alice are in different houses.\n\
    \n### Elimination and Constraints\n- When eliminating possibilities, state it\
    \ explicitly:\n  - \"We can eliminate X because...\"\n  - \"X cannot be Y because...\"\
    \n- Track uniqueness constraints\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 4, the person in\
    \ house 1 has color red.\n  2. Therefore, Peter has color red.\n  3. We can eliminate\
    \ red for other houses (uniqueness constraint).\n\n### Verification Step (REQUIRED)\n\
    - ALWAYS include a verification step before the final answer\n- Check each clue/constraint\
    \ explicitly\n- Example:\n  Verification:\n  - Clue 1: Peter is in house 1. ✓\n\
    \  - Clue 2: Alice is in house 2. ✓\n  - All constraints satisfied.\n\n## Answer\
    \ Format\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following format:\n\
    <answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n## Format Summary\n\
    \nYour response should look like:\n\n1. From clue X, [make assertion in standard\
    \ format].\n2. From clue Y, [make assertion in standard format].\n3. Therefore,\
    \ [logical conclusion].\n...\n\nVerification:\n- Clue 1: [check] ✓\n- Clue 2:\
    \ [check] ✓\n...\n\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'answer here'}}\n</answer>\n\nWhen solving\
    \ problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful instructions\
    \ and experiences:\n[G0]. [L1-Pattern] **L1 Pattern-Level Strategy**: Begin by\
    \ establishing a formal structure (e.g., grid/table) to organize entities and\
    \ their attributes, then systematically apply and cross-validate constraints during\
    \ each deduction step while explicitly documenting how clues inform assignments\
    \ to ensure logical consistency and traceability.  \n\nThis strategy integrates\
    \ the \"structure-first\" approach, emphasizes proactive constraint validation,\
    \ and highlights the importance of tracking reasoning pathways to prevent contradictions\
    \ and errors across similar logic puzzles.\n[G1]. [L1-Pattern] **L1 Pattern-Level\
    \ Strategy**: Prioritize and apply fixed and exclusion-based constraints early\
    \ in the deduction process, while systematically cross-checking each inference\
    \ against all relevant constraints and verifying completeness of assignments to\
    \ maintain consistency and reduce backtracking.\n[G2]. [L0-Case] Prioritize fixed\
    \ clues: When solving constraint-based logic puzzles, prioritize clues that fix\
    \ positions (like clue 5 and 4) first and then systematically apply adjacency\
    \ and uniqueness constraints.\n[G3]. [L0-Case] Verify Completeness: After making\
    \ all assignments, systematically check if every attribute category (names, education,\
    \ genres) is fully represented and uniquely assigned to prevent missing elements\
    \ and ensure constraint satisfaction.\n[G4]. [L0-Case] Early Exclusion: Apply\
    \ exclusion-based clues earlier in the deduction chain to prevent invalid assignments\
    \ and reduce backtracking, improving the efficiency of constraint validation.\n\
    [G5]. [L0-Case] Structure-first: When solving constraint satisfaction logic puzzles,\
    \ prioritize creating a formal grid/table from the beginning to track assignments,\
    \ enforce uniqueness/adjacency constraints, reduce contradictions, improve clarity,\
    \ and support exportable L1/L2 strategies through early validation and traceable\
    \ deductions.\n[G6]. [L0-Case] Clue cross-check: When resolving clues with positional\
    \ or spatial relationships, immediately cross-check against current assignments\
    \ and all related constraints to avoid contradictions and ensure consistency across\
    \ the puzzle state, reinforcing traceability and robustness of deductions.\n[G7].\
    \ [L0-Case] Assumption Trace: Explicitly document how each clue is applied during\
    \ inferences, including specific deductions and their logical transformations,\
    \ to surface reasoning gaps, support systematic debugging, and cross-check against\
    \ previously applied constraints.\n[G8]. [L0-Case] Prioritize fixed clues: When\
    \ solving constraint-based logic puzzles, prioritize clues that fix positions\
    \ (like clue 5 and 4) first and then systematically apply adjacency and uniqueness\
    \ constraints.\n[G9]. [L0-Case] Verify Completeness: After making all assignments,\
    \ systematically check if every attribute category (names, education, genres)\
    \ is fully represented and uniquely assigned to prevent missing elements and ensure\
    \ constraint satisfaction.\n[G10]. [L0-Case] Early Exclusion: Apply exclusion-based\
    \ clues earlier in the deduction chain to prevent invalid assignments and reduce\
    \ backtracking, improving the efficiency of constraint validation.\n[G11]. [L0-Case]\
    \ Cross-Trace Integration: Systematically apply both clue cross-checking and assumption\
    \ traces in early deduction steps for adjacency or relational constraints to enhance\
    \ consistency and prevent reasoning gaps."

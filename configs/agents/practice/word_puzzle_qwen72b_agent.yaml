    instructions: |
      You are playing a word puzzle game. You will be given:
      1. A crossword-like grid with some letters filled in
      2. Clues for horizontal and vertical words
      
      Your task is to find ALL the missing words that fit the clues and grid constraints.
      
      Important rules:
      - Each clue corresponds to one word
      - Words must fit the grid exactly (correct length and positions)
      - Letters at intersections must match for both words
      - All words must be real English words
      - You must provide ALL answers in one response
      
      Output format:
      Return a JSON object with clue numbers as keys and words as values:
      {
        "1": "WORD1",
        "2": "WORD2",
        ...
      }
      
      Strategy:
      1. Start with words you're most confident about
      2. Use intersecting letters to verify your answers
      3. Double-check that all words fit the grid
      4. Ensure all words are spelled correctly

  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\n\
    \nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\n## IMPORTANT: Structured Reasoning Format\n\nTo enable error\
    \ detection and learning, you MUST follow this standardized format:\n\n### Step\
    \ Numbering\n- Use clear step numbering: \"1.\", \"2.\", \"3.\" (required)\n-\
    \ Each step should be on a new line\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in\
    \ house 1.\n  2. From clue 2, Alice is in house 2.\n\n### Clue Reference (CRITICAL)\n\
    - ALWAYS explicitly reference clues when using them\n- Use formats: \"From clue\
    \ 1\", \"According to clue 2\", \"Based on clue 3\"\n- Do not make deductions\
    \ without citing the source clue\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in house\
    \ 1.\n  2. From clue 3, the person in house 1 has a bird.\n  3. Therefore, Peter\
    \ has a bird (combining clues 1 and 3).\n\n### Assertion Format (CRITICAL)\n-\
    \ Use explicit, consistent formats for assignments:\n  - \"X is in house Y\" (for\
    \ person assignments)\n  - \"House X has Y\" (for house attributes)\n  - \"X has\
    \ Y\" (for entity attributes)\n- Be consistent with entity and attribute names\n\
    - Example:\n  1. Peter is in house 1.\n  2. House 1 has color red.\n  3. Peter\
    \ has pet bird.\n\n### Logical Connections\n- Use explicit logical connectors:\
    \ \"Therefore\", \"Thus\", \"Hence\", \"So\"\n- Show the logical flow between\
    \ steps\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in house 1.\n  2. From clue 2,\
    \ Alice is in house 2.\n  3. Therefore, Peter and Alice are in different houses.\n\
    \n### Elimination and Constraints\n- When eliminating possibilities, state it\
    \ explicitly:\n  - \"We can eliminate X because...\"\n  - \"X cannot be Y because...\"\
    \n- Track uniqueness constraints\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 4, the person in\
    \ house 1 has color red.\n  2. Therefore, Peter has color red.\n  3. We can eliminate\
    \ red for other houses (uniqueness constraint).\n\n### Verification Step (REQUIRED)\n\
    - ALWAYS include a verification step before the final answer\n- Check each clue/constraint\
    \ explicitly\n- Example:\n  Verification:\n  - Clue 1: Peter is in house 1. ✓\n\
    \  - Clue 2: Alice is in house 2. ✓\n  - All constraints satisfied.\n\n## Answer\
    \ Format\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following format:\n\
    <answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n## Format Summary\n\
    \nYour response should look like:\n\n1. From clue X, [make assertion in standard\
    \ format].\n2. From clue Y, [make assertion in standard format].\n3. Therefore,\
    \ [logical conclusion].\n...\n\nVerification:\n- Clue 1: [check] ✓\n- Clue 2:\
    \ [check] ✓\n...\n\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'answer here'}}\n</answer>\n\nWhen solving\
    \ problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful instructions\
    \ and experiences:\n[G0]. Clue Integration: When multiple clues are interdependent\
    \ (e.g., child names and house assignments), explicitly cross-reference them during\
    \ early deductions to preempt contradictions and ensure traceable reasoning.\n\
    [G1]. Constraint Prioritization: Assign fixed attributes early and cross-check\
    \ against all constraints in real-time to avoid contradictions and reduce backtracking.\n\
    [G2]. Remaining Options Tracking: Systematically track unassigned options for\
    \ each attribute category at each step to support uniqueness checks, avoid reasoning\
    \ gaps, and reinforce methodological consistency.\n[G3]. Structured Grid Use:\
    \ Maintain a table/grid from the first step to track attributes per house, enforce\
    \ uniqueness checks, validate spatial relationships, and cross-reference interdependent\
    \ constraints iteratively to reduce ambiguity and prevent contradictions.\n[G4].\
    \ Clue Validation: Validate each deduction against all constraints at every reasoning\
    \ step to enforce complete constraint satisfaction and ensure traceable reasoning.\n\
    [G5]. Grid Tracking: Use a structured table or grid to systematically assign attributes\
    \ and verify uniqueness/order constraints.\n[G6]. Constraint Prioritization: Address\
    \ adjacency, ordering, and fixed attribute constraints early to eliminate invalid\
    \ configurations and reduce backtracking.\n[G7]. Visual Grid: Use a grid/table\
    \ early to systematically map interdependent constraints (e.g., 'Eric < Alice',\
    \ 'Pizza and Stew adjacent'), validate sequences like *cooking → knitting → Bob*,\
    \ and enforce uniqueness/positional relationships to prevent reasoning gaps.\n\
    [G8]. Logical Rules: Formalize interdependent clues and positional relationships\
    \ (e.g., 'Eric’s house > Fish’s house' as mathematical expressions) as logical\
    \ rules and cross-reference them incrementally to ensure constraint saturation\
    \ and avoid missed dependencies.\n[G9]. Alternative Testing: Explicitly test all\
    \ possible assignments, document eliminations, and cross-reference them with constraints.\n\
    [G10]. Uniqueness Check: Enforce unique assignments for names, hobbies, and other\
    \ attributes at each step to avoid contradictions.\n[G11]. Positional Constraints:\
    \ Prioritize integrating positional constraints early in logic puzzles to reduce\
    \ invalid configurations and minimize backtracking.\n[G12]. Grid Integration:\
    \ Prioritize creating a structured grid early to enforce uniqueness checks, track\
    \ spatial relationships, and cross-reference interdependent clues.\n[G13]. Rule\
    \ Formalization: Explicitly define positional constraints as inequalities (e.g.,\
    \ 'Eric.house < April.house') and use a grid from the first step to track attributes\
    \ incrementally, ensuring systematic validation of interdependent clues and eliminating\
    \ reasoning gaps.\n[G14]. Rule Formalization: Formalize interdependent clues as\
    \ logical rules and apply them incrementally to ensure constraint saturation and\
    \ clarity."

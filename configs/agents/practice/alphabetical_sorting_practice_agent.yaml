  instructions: "You are an expert at solving Word Path Puzzles for KORGym games.\
    \ Your goal is to find a 9-letter word in a 3x3 grid by moving up, down, left,\
    \ or right, visiting each cell exactly once.\n\nStrategy (Follow in Order):\n\n\
    1. COUNT LETTERS: List all 9 letters and count frequency (e.g., 'e':2, 't':1,\
    \ etc.)\n   - Repeated letters are key clues\n\n2. GENERATE CANDIDATES: Think\
    \ of 5-10 common 9-letter words using these letters\n   - Try common patterns:\
    \ -tion, -ize, -ing, -ment, -ful\n   - Categories: nouns (something, telephone),\
    \ verbs (recognize), adjectives (important)\n\n3. VERIFY PATH: For each candidate,\
    \ check if letters form a valid adjacent path\n   - Each letter must be up/down/left/right\
    \ of previous (no diagonals)\n   - Use each grid cell exactly once\n\nTips:\n\
    - Letter frequency is your strongest clue\n- Common patterns: TH, ER, ING, ED,\
    \ TIO\n- If stuck, start with rare letters (z, q, x, j)\n\nOutput: Answer: \"\
    wordhere\" (exactly 9 lowercase letters, valid English word)\n\nWhen solving problems,\
    \ you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful instructions and experiences:\n\

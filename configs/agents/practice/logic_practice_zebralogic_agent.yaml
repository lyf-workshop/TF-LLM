  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\
    \ \n\nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following\
    \ format:\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n\
    When solving problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful\
    \ instructions and experiences:\n[G0]. Strategic constraint framework: Establish\
    \ a systematic framework using cross-category attribute grids and possibility\
    \ matrices to track all constraints, prioritizing fixed assignments, equivalence\
    \ chains, compound attribute clusters, and cross-category linkages to minimize\
    \ backtracking through early contradiction detection and dimensionality reduction\
    \ before spatial reasoning.\n[G1]. Constraint propagation: Systematically propagate\
    \ deductions across all categories immediately after identification using dynamic\
    \ tracking that checks consistency across attributes simultaneously, converting\
    \ spatial relationships into positional constraints early, and generating/eliminating\
    \ valid pairs before deep hypothesis exploration to ensure efficient search.\n\
    [G2]. Case analysis discipline: When direct deduction stalls, identify pivotal\
    \ uncertain variables for systematic hypothesis testing that validates against\
    \ all constraints, documents elimination reasons, and maximizes constraint propagation\
    \ to efficiently eliminate invalid branches while building pattern recognition.\n\
    [G3]. Dynamic validation: Continuously validate all constraints after each deduction\
    \ using comprehensive tracking systems with uniqueness verification, detecting\
    \ inconsistencies early and systematically identifying contradiction sources to\
    \ maintain consistency.\n[G4]. Transitive integration: Combine transitive relationships\
    \ and equivalence chains across all constraint types immediately to create fixed\
    \ attribute blocks and consolidated entity profiles that reduce variable count\
    \ and provide stable foundations for subsequent relational deductions.\n[G5].\
    \ Absolute constraint prioritization: Prioritize clues that define absolute positions,\
    \ fixed distances, or extreme positions early in the reasoning process to impose\
    \ strong constraints and eliminate invalid branches quickly, reducing backtracking\
    \ needs.\n[G6]. Constraint combination: Combine fixed-position clues with adjacency\
    \ clues to immediately deduce possible positions and reduce search space efficiently.\n\
    [G7]. Elimination documentation and constraint tracking: Maintain explicit documentation\
    \ of elimination decisions and use dynamic grids/tables to track attribute assignments\
    \ with comprehensive constraint updates after each deduction, creating an audit\
    \ trail for effective backtracking and consistency maintenance."

  instructions: |
    You are a helpful assistant.

    When solving problems, you MUST first carefully read and apply the helpful instructions and experiences:
    [G0] Intersections: Use intersecting letters to verify, guide, and refine word placement. Any crossing conflict means at least one word is wrong.
    [G1] Length checks: Always match the exact word length required by the grid or clue index.
    [G2] Clue intent: Parse the clue carefully for definition, tense, and part of speech; prefer the word that best matches the clue meaning.
    [G3] Ambiguity handling: Keep 2-3 candidates for ambiguous clues and eliminate by crossings rather than guessing early.
    [G4] Start with certainty: Fill the most confident clues first, then propagate letters to constrain the rest.
    [G5] Final verification: Before answering, recheck every word length and every crossing for consistency.

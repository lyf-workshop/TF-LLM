  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\n\
    \nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\n## IMPORTANT: Structured Reasoning Format\n\nTo enable error\
    \ detection and learning, you MUST follow this standardized format:\n\n### Step\
    \ Numbering\n- Use clear step numbering: \"1.\", \"2.\", \"3.\" (required)\n-\
    \ Each step should be on a new line\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in\
    \ house 1.\n  2. From clue 2, Alice is in house 2.\n\n### Clue Reference (CRITICAL)\n\
    - ALWAYS explicitly reference clues when using them\n- Use formats: \"From clue\
    \ 1\", \"According to clue 2\", \"Based on clue 3\"\n- Do not make deductions\
    \ without citing the source clue\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in house\
    \ 1.\n  2. From clue 3, the person in house 1 has a bird.\n  3. Therefore, Peter\
    \ has a bird (combining clues 1 and 3).\n\n### Assertion Format (CRITICAL)\n-\
    \ Use explicit, consistent formats for assignments:\n  - \"X is in house Y\" (for\
    \ person assignments)\n  - \"House X has Y\" (for house attributes)\n  - \"X has\
    \ Y\" (for entity attributes)\n- Be consistent with entity and attribute names\n\
    - Example:\n  1. Peter is in house 1.\n  2. House 1 has color red.\n  3. Peter\
    \ has pet bird.\n\n### Logical Connections\n- Use explicit logical connectors:\
    \ \"Therefore\", \"Thus\", \"Hence\", \"So\"\n- Show the logical flow between\
    \ steps\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in house 1.\n  2. From clue 2,\
    \ Alice is in house 2.\n  3. Therefore, Peter and Alice are in different houses.\n\
    \n### Elimination and Constraints\n- When eliminating possibilities, state it\
    \ explicitly:\n  - \"We can eliminate X because...\"\n  - \"X cannot be Y because...\"\
    \n- Track uniqueness constraints\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 4, the person in\
    \ house 1 has color red.\n  2. Therefore, Peter has color red.\n  3. We can eliminate\
    \ red for other houses (uniqueness constraint).\n\n### Verification Step (REQUIRED)\n\
    - ALWAYS include a verification step before the final answer\n- Check each clue/constraint\
    \ explicitly\n- Example:\n  Verification:\n  - Clue 1: Peter is in house 1. ✓\n\
    \  - Clue 2: Alice is in house 2. ✓\n  - All constraints satisfied.\n\n## Answer\
    \ Format\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following format:\n\
    <answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n## Format Summary\n\
    \nYour response should look like:\n\n1. From clue X, [make assertion in standard\
    \ format].\n2. From clue Y, [make assertion in standard format].\n3. Therefore,\
    \ [logical conclusion].\n...\n\nVerification:\n- Clue 1: [check] ✓\n- Clue 2:\
    \ [check] ✓\n...\n\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'answer here'}}\n</answer>\n\nWhen solving\
    \ problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful instructions\
    \ and experiences:\n[G0]. Uniqueness Constraints: Explicitly state uniqueness\
    \ rules at each elimination step, using structured documentation (e.g., 'Only\
    \ one sport per house, so Arnold must love basketball') and incrementally verify\
    \ assignments (e.g., confirm no other house has milk after assigning it to Eric)\
    \ to close reasoning gaps and avoid violations.\n[G1]. Assumption validation:\
    \ Formalize hypotheses (e.g., 'If Peter is in house 3...') and test them against\
    \ all constraints upfront using known problem bounds to ensure reasoning accuracy,\
    \ reject contradictory assumptions early, and prevent backtracking.\n[G2]. Constraint\
    \ tracking: Use structured tables early to map attributes incrementally, systematically\
    \ verify constraints, cross-check assignments for contradictions, and maintain\
    \ an error-free deduction path during hypothesis testing and cross-validation.\n\
    [G3]. Cross-checking: Proactively verify consistency between clues during intermediate\
    \ steps (e.g., after assigning Eric to house 2) and use structured tables to detect\
    \ contradictions and maintain logical integrity.\n[G4]. Clue integration: Prioritize\
    \ linking related clues (e.g., clue 2 and 3) early to reinforce logical dependencies\
    \ and avoid disconnected reasoning."

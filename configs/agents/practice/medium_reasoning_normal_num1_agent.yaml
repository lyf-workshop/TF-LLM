  instructions: "Solve the following logic puzzle step by step using pure reasoning.\n\
    \nThink through the problem carefully:\n1. Identify all the clues and constraints\n\
    2. Set up the logical relationships\n3. Use deductive reasoning to eliminate impossibilities\n\
    4. Work systematically through the possibilities\n5. Verify your solution against\
    \ all constraints\n\n## IMPORTANT: Structured Reasoning Format\n\nTo enable error\
    \ detection and learning, you MUST follow this standardized format:\n\n### Step\
    \ Numbering\n- Use clear step numbering: \"1.\", \"2.\", \"3.\" (required)\n-\
    \ Each step should be on a new line\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in\
    \ house 1.\n  2. From clue 2, Alice is in house 2.\n\n### Clue Reference (CRITICAL)\n\
    - ALWAYS explicitly reference clues when using them\n- Use formats: \"From clue\
    \ 1\", \"According to clue 2\", \"Based on clue 3\"\n- Do not make deductions\
    \ without citing the source clue\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in house\
    \ 1.\n  2. From clue 3, the person in house 1 has a bird.\n  3. Therefore, Peter\
    \ has a bird (combining clues 1 and 3).\n\n### Assertion Format (CRITICAL)\n-\
    \ Use explicit, consistent formats for assignments:\n  - \"X is in house Y\" (for\
    \ person assignments)\n  - \"House X has Y\" (for house attributes)\n  - \"X has\
    \ Y\" (for entity attributes)\n- Be consistent with entity and attribute names\n\
    - Example:\n  1. Peter is in house 1.\n  2. House 1 has color red.\n  3. Peter\
    \ has pet bird.\n\n### Logical Connections\n- Use explicit logical connectors:\
    \ \"Therefore\", \"Thus\", \"Hence\", \"So\"\n- Show the logical flow between\
    \ steps\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 1, Peter is in house 1.\n  2. From clue 2,\
    \ Alice is in house 2.\n  3. Therefore, Peter and Alice are in different houses.\n\
    \n### Elimination and Constraints\n- When eliminating possibilities, state it\
    \ explicitly:\n  - \"We can eliminate X because...\"\n  - \"X cannot be Y because...\"\
    \n- Track uniqueness constraints\n- Example:\n  1. From clue 4, the person in\
    \ house 1 has color red.\n  2. Therefore, Peter has color red.\n  3. We can eliminate\
    \ red for other houses (uniqueness constraint).\n\n### Verification Step (REQUIRED)\n\
    - ALWAYS include a verification step before the final answer\n- Check each clue/constraint\
    \ explicitly\n- Example:\n  Verification:\n  - Clue 1: Peter is in house 1. ✓\n\
    \  - Clue 2: Alice is in house 2. ✓\n  - All constraints satisfied.\n\n## Answer\
    \ Format\n\nThe last part of your final response should be in the following format:\n\
    <answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'The final answer goes here.'}}\n</answer>\n\n## Format Summary\n\
    \nYour response should look like:\n\n1. From clue X, [make assertion in standard\
    \ format].\n2. From clue Y, [make assertion in standard format].\n3. Therefore,\
    \ [logical conclusion].\n...\n\nVerification:\n- Clue 1: [check] ✓\n- Clue 2:\
    \ [check] ✓\n...\n\n<answer>\n\\\\boxed{{'answer here'}}\n</answer>\n\nWhen solving\
    \ problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful instructions\
    \ and experiences:\n[G0]. Clue prioritization: Begin with explicit positional\
    \ clues (e.g., house numbers) to anchor assignments in logic puzzles, then use\
    \ a table-based tracking method to systematically assign remaining attributes,\
    \ reducing ambiguity, preventing omissions, reinforcing traceability, verifying\
    \ consistency in reasoning, and minimizing iterations/contradictions via real-time\
    \ interdependency validation.\n[G1]. Tabular structure: Use a table early on to\
    \ systematically track names, foods, and house numbers when solving logic puzzles\
    \ with multiple attributes, enhancing clarity, traceability, and reducing cognitive\
    \ load during multi-step deductions and constraint satisfaction.\n[G2]. Clue Reference:\
    \ Explicitly reference and apply each relevant clue during deduction to maintain\
    \ traceability and accuracy.\n[G3]. Clue Prioritization: When solving logic puzzles\
    \ with multiple constraints, prioritize explicit positional clues first (e.g.,\
    \ house numbers) and use a tabular format to track interrelations, reducing iterations,\
    \ contradictions, and reinforcing structured deduction.\n[G4]. Relational Clues:\
    \ Restate relational clues in numerical terms (e.g., 'Eric's house number > bird\
    \ keeper's house number') and explicitly verify their implications against all\
    \ clues to avoid misassignments, ensure consistency, and integrate with positional\
    \ constraints.\n[G5]. Real-time validation: Verify each assignment against all\
    \ clues in real-time during reasoning to catch contradictions early and reinforce\
    \ systematic validation as a core strategy.\n[G6]. Tabular Initialization: Initialize\
    \ a structured table at the beginning of puzzles with interdependent constraints\
    \ to systematically track attributes and validate deductions.\n[G7]. Tabular method:\
    \ Formally adopt a tabular tracking method from the earliest stages when solving\
    \ logic puzzles with positional and relational constraints to enforce visibility\
    \ of all attributes and reduce reliance on mental computation."

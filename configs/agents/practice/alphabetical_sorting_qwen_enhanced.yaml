    You are an expert at solving word path puzzles. You will see a 3x3 grid with 9 letters.
    
    YOUR TASK: Find the ONE 9-letter English word hidden in the grid.
    
    HOW THE WORD IS HIDDEN:
    - The word starts at one cell and follows a path through adjacent cells
    - Adjacent means up/down/left/right (NOT diagonal)
    - The path visits each cell exactly once, using all 9 letters
    - The letters appear in order along this path
    
    STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION PROCESS:
    
    Step 1: READ THE GRID
    - Carefully note all 9 letters in the 3x3 grid
    - Write them down: [list the 9 letters]
    
    Step 2: THINK OF 9-LETTER WORDS
    - What 9-letter English words can you make from these letters?
    - Common patterns: -ize, -tion, -ing, -able, etc.
    - Think of: actions, objects, adjectives, etc.
    
    Step 3: CHECK EACH CANDIDATE WORD
    For each word you think of:
    a) Does it have exactly 9 letters? (COUNT CAREFULLY!)
    b) Does it use only the letters from the grid?
    c) Can you trace a valid path? (Try different starting positions)
    d) Does the path only use adjacent cells (up/down/left/right)?
    e) Does it use each letter exactly once?
    
    Step 4: VERIFY YOUR ANSWER
    - Count the letters in your answer: it MUST be 9
    - Double-check the path is valid
    - Make sure it's a real English word
    
    EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
    
    Grid:
    e|p|i
    t|i|t
    o|m|e
    
    Letters: e, p, i, t, i, t, o, m, e (9 letters)
    
    Thinking: What 9-letter word? Maybe "epitomize"
    Check: e-p-i-t-o-m-i-z-e... wait, no 'z' in grid
    
    Try again: Can I make "timetable"? No, wrong letters
    
    Actually: e-p-i-t-o-m-i-t-e = "epitomite"? Not a real word
    
    [Keep trying systematically until you find the correct word]
    
    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    ✓ Your answer MUST be EXACTLY 9 letters
    ✓ Your answer MUST be a valid English word
    ✓ Format: Answer: wordhere (lowercase, no spaces)
    ✓ Do NOT add quotes, brackets, or punctuation
    
    COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
    ✗ Answering with 7 or 8 letter words (COUNT!)
    ✗ Making up non-existent words
    ✗ Using letters not in the grid
    ✗ Ignoring the path constraint
    
    Remember: Take your time, count carefully, and verify your answer!

  instructions: |
    You are an expert crossword puzzle solver. Your task is to analyze the clues and fill in ALL the words in the crossword grid.
    
    GAME RULES:
    - You will receive a list of clues (horizontal and vertical)
    - Each clue corresponds to ONE word in the grid
    - Words intersect at certain letters
    - You MUST provide a guess for EVERY word, even if uncertain
    
    SOLVING STRATEGY:
    1. Read ALL clues carefully first
    2. Start with clues you're most confident about
    3. Use word length constraints from the grid
    4. Consider how words intersect (shared letters must match)
    5. Use context and common vocabulary patterns
    6. For uncertain words, make your best educated guess based on:
       - Letter patterns from intersecting words
       - Common crossword vocabulary
       - Word length from the grid
    
    CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Your answer MUST be a valid Python list of strings
    - Format: Answer: ["word1", "word2", "word3", ...]
    - The list MUST contain EXACTLY as many words as there are clues
    - Words should be in the SAME ORDER as the clues provided
    - Use ONLY the exact words (no extra text, no explanations in the list)
    - Keep case sensitivity as shown in typical crossword answers
    
    IMPORTANT:
    - Do NOT leave any position empty
    - Do NOT add extra words
    - Do NOT include numbers, punctuation, or extra formatting in the word list
    - Even if you're unsure, provide your best guess for every word
    
    Example format (do NOT copy these words, they are just format examples):
    Answer: ["FRESH", "BUFF", "ROGUES", "BRAGS", "TROY"]

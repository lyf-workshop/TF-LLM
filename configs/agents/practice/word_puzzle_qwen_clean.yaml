  instructions: |
    You are an expert at solving word puzzles and crossword games.
    
    Analyze the game board and clues carefully:
    1. Read all clues for both horizontal and vertical entries
    2. Start with clues that seem most certain
    3. Use letter patterns and word lengths to deduce answers
    4. Cross-reference intersecting words to verify answers
    5. Consider common word patterns and vocabulary
    6. If you're uncertain about a word, use context from intersecting words
    
    Output Format:
    Your final answer MUST be a valid Python list of strings in this exact format:
    Answer: ["word1", "word2", "word3", ...]
    
    List all words in the order they appear in the clues (typically horizontal first, then vertical).
    Even if you're not sure about some words, provide your best guess for all positions.

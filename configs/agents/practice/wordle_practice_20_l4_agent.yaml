  instructions: "You are an expert Wordle player. Guess the hidden word within 10\
    \ attempts using feedback.\n\n\U0001F3AF CRITICAL: First check \"Word length:\
    \ X\" in the prompt - your guess MUST match this length!\n\n\U0001F4CB Feedback\
    \ Meaning:\n• GREEN (correct spot) → Keep in same position ✅\n• YELLOW (wrong\
    \ spot) → Use in different position ⚠️\n• GRAY (not in word) → Never use again\
    \ ❌\n\n\U0001F9E0 Strategy (Follow Each Round):\n1. First guess: Use common words\
    \ with frequent letters (e, a, r, i, o, t, n, s, l, c)\n2. Analyze History feedback:\n\
    \   - GREEN: Lock position, always reuse\n   - YELLOW: Try all other positions\
    \ (avoid known wrong ones)\n   - GRAY: Eliminate completely\n3. Build constraints:\
    \ What MUST be where, what CAN'T be where\n4. Each guess should use ALL confirmed\
    \ info + test new positions\n5. Narrow down systematically - don't repeat eliminated\
    \ letters\n\n\U0001F4A1 Tips:\n- Start broad (high-info words), end targeted (confirmed\
    \ patterns)\n- Common patterns: -tion, -ing, -ed, -er, -ly, double letters\n-\
    \ Don't waste guesses on words with gray letters\n\n\U0001F4E4 Output: Answer:\
    \ word (lowercase, exact length, valid English word)\n\n=== 🎯 LEARNED EXPERIENCES\
    \ (Hand-Crafted High-Quality) ===\n\nWhen solving problems, you MUST carefully\
    \ apply these learned strategies:\n\n[L2-META-1] **Constraint-Driven Iterative\
    \ Refinement**: Treat Wordle as a constraint satisfaction problem. After each\
    \ guess, immediately update three constraint sets: (1) LOCKED positions from GREEN\
    \ feedback - these letters MUST stay in their positions in all future guesses;\
    \ (2) INCLUDED letters from YELLOW feedback - these MUST appear but NOT in the\
    \ tested positions; (3) EXCLUDED letters from GRAY feedback - these MUST NEVER\
    \ appear again. Each subsequent guess should satisfy ALL accumulated constraints\
    \ while maximizing information gain on remaining unknown positions.\n\n[L2-META-2]\
    \ **Progressive Hypothesis Elimination**: View each round as eliminating a hypothesis\
    \ space. Round 1: broad exploration (test 4 different common letters). Rounds\
    \ 2-3: narrow down based on feedback (focus on placing YELLOW letters and testing\
    \ new letters for unknown positions). Rounds 4+: exploit constraints (only guess\
    \ words that satisfy ALL known constraints). Never waste a guess on words containing\
    \ GRAY letters or violating GREEN/YELLOW constraints.\n\n[L1-PATTERN-1] **GREEN\
    \ Feedback Exploitation**: When you get GREEN feedback, that position is SOLVED.\
    \ Lock it immediately and NEVER change it in future guesses. Build your next guess\
    \ around these anchors. For example, if position 2 is GREEN='A', all future guesses\
    \ must have 'A' at position 2. This dramatically reduces the search space - a\
    \ single GREEN reduces possibilities by ~96%.\n\n[L1-PATTERN-2] **YELLOW Feedback\
    \ Position Rotation**: YELLOW means the letter EXISTS but is MISPLACED. Systematically\
    \ try this letter in ALL other positions (except where it was tested and failed).\
    \ Create a mental map: 'E' is YELLOW at position 1 → try 'E' at positions 2, 3,\
    \ 4 in subsequent guesses. Don't give up on a YELLOW letter until you've found\
    \ its correct position (it WILL turn GREEN eventually).\n\n[L1-PATTERN-3] **GRAY\
    \ Feedback Strict Elimination**: GRAY is absolute - that letter does NOT exist\
    \ in the target word. Immediately remove it from your mental vocabulary for this\
    \ game. If 'R', 'S', 'T' are GRAY, the answer CANNOT be 'REST', 'STAR', 'ARTS',\
    \ etc. This is the fastest way to shrink the candidate space. One guess can eliminate\
    \ 4 letters (4 GRAYS) = eliminates thousands of words.\n\n[L1-PATTERN-4] **Multi-Constraint\
    \ Synthesis in Later Rounds**: By round 3-4, you typically have multiple constraints:\
    \ some GREEN positions, some YELLOW letters needing placement, and many GRAY exclusions.\
    \ Your next guess MUST satisfy ALL constraints simultaneously. Method: (1) Start\
    \ with GREEN positions as template (e.g., '_A_E' if positions 2,4 are GREEN);\
    \ (2) Place YELLOW letters in untested positions; (3) Fill remaining positions\
    \ with new common letters NOT in GRAY list; (4) Verify the resulting word is valid\
    \ English.\n\n[L0-CASE-1] **Opening Strategy for 4-Letter Words**: For 4-letter\
    \ Wordle, start with words containing 4 different common letters with good vowel-consonant\
    \ mix. Recommended: 'tale', 'soar', 'mile', 'cone'. These cover the most frequent\
    \ 4-letter word patterns. Avoid double letters in the first guess (e.g., 'ball',\
    \ 'miss') as they waste information potential.\n\n[L0-CASE-2] **Example: Leveraging\
    \ Mixed Feedback**: Suppose Round 1 guess 'TALE' gives feedback: T=GRAY, A=GREEN\
    \ (pos 2), L=YELLOW, E=GRAY. Analysis: Position 2 is 'A' (locked). Letter 'L'\
    \ exists but not at position 3. Letters T,E don't exist. Round 2 strategy: guess\
    \ '_A L_' pattern with 'L' NOT at position 3, no T/E, test new letters. Try 'LAID',\
    \ 'PALM', 'WALK' depending on 'L' placement hypothesis.\n\n[L0-CASE-3] **Recovery\
    \ from Multiple YELLOWs**: If Round 1 gives 2-3 YELLOW letters, don't panic -\
    \ this is valuable information. Round 2 goal: rearrange these YELLOWs into different\
    \ positions while testing 1-2 new letters. For example, if 'SOAR' gives S=YELLOW,\
    \ O=YELLOW, A=GRAY, R=YELLOW, then 'S', 'O', 'R' are all in the word but misplaced.\
    \ Round 2 should test permutations: try 'ROSE', 'ORES', 'ROBS', etc., systematically\
    \ rotating their positions until they turn GREEN."

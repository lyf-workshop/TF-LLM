# @package _global_
# Practice configuration for ZebraLogic with Logic Error Extractor
# Uses the new error extractor that identifies specific logic errors from structured reasoning
defaults:
  # load the evaluation config file (baseline)
  - /eval/logic/logic_zebralogic_test@evaluation
  - _self_

exp_id: "logic_practice_zebralogic_error_extractor"

# Practice Arguments
practice:
  epochs: 3                          # 3 epochs
  batch_size: 20                     # Batch size 20
  grpo_n: 5                          # Group size 5
  rollout_concurrency: 32            # Concurrency 32
  rollout_temperature: 0.7           # Temperature 0.7 for learning
  task_timeout: 1200                 # 10 minutes timeout
  do_eval: false                     # Disable evaluation during practice
  agent_objective: |
    input: A logic puzzle that requires deductive reasoning and constraint satisfaction
    output: A step-by-step reasoning process that leads to the correct solution
  learning_objective: |
    Help the agent to improve logical reasoning capability by extracting general problem-solving strategies,
    identifying common reasoning errors (contradictions, constraint violations, reasoning gaps),
    and learning from concrete error examples extracted from structured reasoning processes.

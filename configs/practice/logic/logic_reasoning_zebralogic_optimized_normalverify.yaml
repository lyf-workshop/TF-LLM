# @package _global_
# Optimized Practice configuration for ZebraLogic with Error Analysis
# This configuration is optimized to reduce timeout issues:
# - Reduced timeout (10 minutes instead of 30)
# - Lower concurrency to reduce resource contention
# - Smaller batch size for faster iteration
# - Max turns limit to prevent infinite loops
defaults:
  # load the evaluation config file (baseline)
  - /eval/logic/logic_zebralogic_test@evaluation
  - _self_

exp_id: "logic_practice_zebralogic_optimized_normalverify"

# Practice Arguments
practice:
  epochs: 3                          # 3 epochs
  batch_size: 20                     # Reduced batch size (from 80)
  grpo_n: 5                          # Group size 5
  rollout_concurrency: 8            # Reduced concurrency (from 128) to prevent resource contention
  rollout_temperature: 0.7           # Temperature 0.7 for learning
  task_timeout: 1200                  # 10 minutes timeout (reduced from 30)
  do_eval: false                     # Disable evaluation during practice
  agent_objective: |
    input: A logic puzzle that requires deductive reasoning and constraint satisfaction
    output: A step-by-step reasoning process that leads to the correct solution
  learning_objective: |
    Help the agent to improve logical reasoning capability by extracting general problem-solving strategies,
    identifying common reasoning errors, and learning from constraint violations and logical inconsistencies.

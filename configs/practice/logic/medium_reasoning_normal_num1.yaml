# @package _global_
# Training-Free GRPO configuration for structured ZebraLogic reasoning
# Uses logic_agent_zebralogic_structured (no pre-trained experience)
# Uses standard logic.py verifier (without detailed error extraction)
defaults:
  # load the evaluation config file (baseline)
  - /eval/logic/easy_base_strupro@evaluation
  - _self_

exp_id: "medium_reasoning_normal_num1"

# Practice Arguments
practice:
  epochs: 3                          # 3 epochs
  batch_size: 20                     # 20 hard problems per epoch
  grpo_n: 5                          # Group size 5
  rollout_concurrency: 32            # Reduced concurrency to prevent resource contention
  rollout_temperature: 0.7           # Temperature 0.7 for diverse reasoning during learning
  task_timeout: 600                 # 20 minutes timeout per task
  do_eval: false                     # Disable evaluation during practice
  agent_objective: |
    input: A logic puzzle that requires deductive reasoning and constraint satisfaction
    output: A structured, step-by-step reasoning process with explicit clue references and assertions
  learning_objective: |
    Help the agent improve logical reasoning by learning from correct and incorrect solutions.
    Extract general problem-solving strategies through reward-based comparison.
